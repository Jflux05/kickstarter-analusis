# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to understand how different theater campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals (specific to plays). We'll be performing data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends associated with launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We will use the data to spotlight any theater campaign trends related to launch dates. The screenshot below illustrates how campaigns fared throughout the year. The lines on the chart indicate the campaign outcome and how many campaigns had a specific outcome type for the 12 months of the year. It is evident that there is a higher volume of theater kickstarter campaigns during the period of April through August. From the analysis we can see that the volume of campaigns overall increase which also increases both successful and failed campaign rates. Canceled campaigns are not impacted as a result of the campaign volume increase and remain flat throughout the majority of the year. It is apparent that no campaigns were canceled during October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We will use the data to identify plays campaign success relative to its goal amount ($).  The screenshot of the chart below illustrates how successful and failed campaigns fared based on their campaign goal amounts. It is evident that campaign success and failure are inversely corrilated. The total sample size is just over 1000 campaigns (1,047), so not a very large data set to work with and make hard conclusions. The most successful campaings had goals that range from $1,000 - $4,999. 76% of play campaigns with this goal range were successfull. This group of successful campaigns represented 51% of the total campaigns. And while there is a range of goals with a higher success rate,(campaigns with goals less than $1,000 had a success rate of 76%), this group of campaigns only represented just under 18% of the total campaigns analyzed. Only 2 (out 16 total) campaigns with goals over $50,000 were successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge's prompt mentions that it wants it to be well described with screenshots, when it should request a brief breakdown of the analysis performed with screenshots to support it. Additionally, I ran into the issues created by a  difference between local and remote git changes. I also learned a little bit about hidden files and how they can introduce a bit of confusion and require complex merging. Additionally, in the analysis based on goals, the data for plays is limited and for that particular subcategory and there are no cancelled campaigns. Finally, in the prompt for the campaigns by goals, the image showing the different goal ranges displays "Greater than 50000" however this appears to be incorrect. The reason being, that if we were to enter >50000 into our COUNTIF formula the results would be different and not capture all of the qualifying campaigns. 

## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- The volume of kickstarter campaigns increases significantly during the summer months. As a result, theater campaigns have the highest success rate when launched between April and August. (They are most successful when launched from May to June). Conversely, campaigns have their highest failure rates during the same period. Its likely that campaign success and total campaigns launched increases substanstially during the summer months as a result of most Americans typically having more personal time available, so they pursue passion projects or come across campaigns while searching the web during their free time. So. with further analysis, it's likely we could get a better understanding of what drives theater campaign success and volume increases during the summer in the United States. 

- Theater campaigns are more successful at the beginning of the year vs the end of the year (when they begin to taper off). This is likely due to the holiday season. We would need further analysis to be sure, but it's likely that campaigns taper off as a result of the holidays occupying American's time and not necessarily freeing up their time like the summer time holidays. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
Play campaigns with lower goal amounts (< $5,000) have the highest success rate. Campaigns with goals ranging from $20,000 to $34,999 have a high failure rate, however it's clear that campaigns with goals over $45,000 have the highest failure rates. Failed campaigns are invesresly corrilated to Successful campaigns. Additonally, the total count of campaigns >$29,999 is significantly lower than the amount of campaigns with goals < $29,999. 

### Limitations and Recommendations 
The data seems to be quite limited in terms of the sample size we are utilizing. Additionally, the analysis itself is pretty limited in its scope because it does not factor in the other important campaign elements, ie. pledge size, total backers, and/or average donation size. Finally, I would suggest gathering more data around campaign donor demographics, donor holiday schedules, and donor holiday free time use. This would provide a significant amount of further insights into what drives campaign success rates. 

I would recommend diving deeper into the data provided by looking into campaign success rates based on total backers (utilizing another a line graph) and then another analysis of how successful play campaigns were based on average donation amount.
